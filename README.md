# Project Title

This Chrome Extension allows you to search through a youtube video similarly to how you'd search through a pdf using "command f". It works by searching through the closed captions.

This is still a work in progress so expect a few issues, also my first forray into Web Development.

## Getting Started

1. In Chrome go to chrome://extensions/
2. Click on Developer Mode
3. Click "Load Unpacked Extension"
4.

## How to use

1. Navigate to youtube to watch a video with closed captions.
2. Refresh the page
2. Type "h" then hit tab in the omnibar to enter search mode
3. Enter your search term into the omnibar
4. Navigate forward and backwards throught the search results using "D" and "S" keys respectively


## Known Issues

It only works on videos with closed captions that are in English, if the captions are listed as being in British English or another varient it won't work.

Every time you go to a new video you need to refresh the page.
